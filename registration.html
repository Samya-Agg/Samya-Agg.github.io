    <h1><b>History of the Event</b></h1>
     <p>
        Halloween evolved from the Samhain holiday celebrated by the Celts of ancient Britain and Ireland. The new year was thought to begin on the day equivalent to November 1 on modern calendars. That date was marked the start of the winter season, when herds were returned from pasture and land tenures were renewed. During the Samhain festival, it was believed that the souls of those who had died 
        would return to their homes, while those who had died during the year would travel to the otherworld.

        Halloween has been celebrated for over a thousand years. Originally a religious practice, it gradually became more secular throughout the ages, until its religious overtones all but vanished.
         Today, Halloween is seen as a holiday for dressing up and having fun, particularly for youngsters.

        People dressed up in costumes and lit bonfires to scare off spirits on that day, as it was believed that the souls of the deceased returned to their houses. Popular
        Halloween motifs like witches, ghosts, and goblins became connected with the holiday in this way.
